# chordRecognizer
Music chord recognizer implemented as a project for the subject 'Multimedia information processing'. 

This was the final project for the subject 'Multimedia information processing'. This chord recognizar is primarily focused on the recognition of guitar chords, since it has been trained with a data set of guitar chords created by the University of Liège.

What we did for this project was trying to recreate the results obtained [in this paper](http://jim.afim-asso.org/jim12/pdf/jim2012_08_p_osmalskyj.pdf).
## Classification Algorithms

The classification algorithms we used were a k-nn classifier and a multi class svm. For the multiclass svm we applied cross-validation to optimize the sigma.
